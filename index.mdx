title: "Introduction"
description: "HasMCP is a no-code builder designed to instantly convert standard HTTP APIs into Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Instead of writing and maintaining custom Python or TypeScript code to expose your internal tools or third-party APIs to LLMs (like Claude or Gemini), HasMCP allows creating MCP servers without any coding by wrapping your endpoints with the latest protocol spec using Streamable HTTP."

### Why use HasMCP?

**No-Code Bridge**: Import an OpenAPI spec or manually define endpoints, and HasMCP handles the protocol implementation.

**Centralized Secrets**: Manage API keys and credentials securely in one place, injecting them dynamically into requests.

**Instant Deployment**: Generate a configuration snippet instantly to connect your new MCP server to clients like Claude Desktop or Google's Gemini.

## Core Concepts

HasMCP is built around a hierarchy of four main concepts. Understanding how these relate will help you build robust servers.

### 1. Environment Variables

_The secure foundation for credentials._

Before you can connect to most APIs, you need secrets (API Keys, Bearer Tokens). In HasMCP, these are stored as **Environment Variables**.

- **Type Safety**: Variables can be standard `ENV` (visible) or `SECRET` (masked in the UI).
- **Naming Convention**: HasMCP enforces `CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `STRIPE_API_KEY`) to ensure compatibility across different provider configurations.
- **Injection**: These variables are referenced in your Provider Headers using the `${VAR_NAME}` syntax.

### 2. Providers

_The definition of the external service._

A **Provider** represents a specific external API service (e.g., Stripe, GitHub, or your internal backend).

- **Base URL**: The root address for all requests (e.g., `https://api.stripe.com/v1`).
- **Authentication**: Supports standard Header authentication and OAuth2 flows.
- **Immutable Prefix**: When creating a provider, HasMCP generates a "Secret Prefix" (e.g., `API_STRIPE_COM`). All Environment Variables used by this provider must start with this prefix to ensure security isolation.

### 3. Provider Endpoints (Tools)

_The specific actions available to the LLM._

**Endpoints** are the individual tools attached to a Provider. When you expose an Endpoint, it becomes a "Tool" that the LLM can call.

- **Definition**: Defined by an HTTP Method (GET, POST, etc.) and a Path (e.g., `/customers/{id}`).
- **Schemas**: HasMCP allows you to define JSON schemas for **Query Arguments** and **Request Bodies**, ensuring the LLM knows exactly how to structure its requests.
- **Importing**: You can bulk-import endpoints using standard OpenAPI v3 or Swagger v2 specifications.

### 4. MCP Servers

_The deployable bundle._

An **MCP Server** is the final wrapper that you connect to your LLM client.

- **Bundling**: It groups a specific Provider and a selection of its Endpoints.
- **Access Control**: You generate time-limited access tokens for the server.
- **Configuration**: HasMCP generates the specific JSON configuration needed for clients like **Claude Desktop** or **Gemini CLI** to recognize and connect to your server.
- **Authorize What You Need**: Select what endpoints that you need from a specific provider.
