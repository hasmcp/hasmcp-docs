# Using MCP in Cursor

Cursor provides native support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing its AI features like Composer and Chat to directly use tools and context from your HasMCP servers.

## 1. Setup via Settings UI

The easiest way to add a server is through Cursor's graphical interface.

1.  Open **Cursor Settings** (Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd + ,` on macOS or `Ctrl + ,` on Windows).
2.  Navigate to **Cursor Settings > MCP**.
3.  Click the **+ Add New MCP Server** button.
4.  Configure the following fields:
    - **Name**: A recognizable name (e.g., `hasmcp-prod`).
    - **Type**: Select `sse` (Server-Sent Events) for remote HasMCP connections.
    - **URL**: Your HasMCP server endpoint (e.g., `https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>`).

## 2. Setup via `mcp.json` (Advanced)

For version-controlled or global configuration, you can edit the `mcp.json` file directly.

### Configuration Paths

- **Global (macOS/Linux)**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Global (Windows)**: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`
- **Project-Specific**: `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root

### Example Configuration

Add your server details to the `mcpServers` object. Use headers to provide your HasMCP access token:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hasmcp-server": {
      "url": "https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>",
      "headers": {
        "x-hasmcp-key": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verifying the Connection

Once added, your server will appear in the MCP servers list.

Status Indicator: A green dot next to the server name indicates a successful connection.

Tool Discovery: Expand the server entry to see the list of tools that Cursor has discovered from your HasMCP configuration.

Using in Chat: You can now ask Cursor to use specific tools by name (e.g., "Use my db-agent tool to query the users table").

## Troubleshooting

Token Expiry: If the connection dot turns red, your token may have expired. Generate a new one in the HasMCP dashboard and update your config.

Restarting: After manually editing mcp.json, you must restart Cursor for the changes to take effect.
