# Connecting to ChatGPT

You can connect your HasMCP servers to ChatGPT by creating a **Custom GPT Apps**. This allows ChatGPT to interact with your tools and APIs using the OpenAPI specification provided by HasMCP.

## Setup Instructions

For ChatGPT Apps, HasMCP allows you to pass your access key directly in the URL using a query string, simplifying the configuration process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Token">
    In your HasMCP dashboard, navigate to your **MCP Server** and click **Generate Token** to create a secure access key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Construct the MCP URL">
    ChatGPT requires a base URL for the Apps. Append your token to your server's endpoint using the `token` query parameter.

    On top right of the screen click on **Settings**:

    ```text
    Settings » Apps » Advanced settings » Create app » Enter details below » Create
    ```

    * **Name**: `myServer`
    * **Description**: Your description
    * **MCP Server URL**: `https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>?token=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`
    * **Authentication**: Choose `No Auth` since we passed the token as query string already.

    Click the **Create** button at the bottom of the modal window to activate the MCP Server.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why use Query Strings?

While standard MCP clients use the `x-hasmcp-key` header, using the `?token=<>` query string is ideal for ChatGPT Actions because:

- **Compatibility**: It bypasses potential header-stripping issues in the ChatGPT Action interface.
- **Simplicity**: You do not need to configure an "API Key" in the ChatGPT authentication settings.
- **Security**: The token is still validated by HasMCP before any tools are executed.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Token Mismatch">
    Ensure there are no spaces or extra characters in the `?token=` value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Endpoint Errors">
    Ensure the `SERVER_ID` in the URL matches the one provided in your
    dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Method Support">
    ChatGPT Actions primarily use standard HTTP methods (GET/POST). Ensure your
    tools are configured correctly in the HasMCP Provider.
