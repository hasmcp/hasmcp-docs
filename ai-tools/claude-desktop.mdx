# Connecting to Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) natively, allowing you to bridge remote HasMCP servers directly into your chat sessions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Locate the Configuration File

Claude Desktop reads its MCP server definitions from a specific JSON file based on your operating system:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Quick Tip**: You can open this file directly from the app by going to **Settings > Developer > Edit Config**.

### 2. Configure the Remote Server

Add your HasMCP server details to the `mcpServers` object in the configuration file. Use the `mcp-remote` utility (provided via `npx`) to establish the connection.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myServer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>",
        "--header",
        "x-hasmcp-key: Bearer ${HASMCP_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "HASMCP_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

SERVER_ID: Your unique server identifier from the HasMCP dashboard.

ACCESS_TOKEN: The secure token generated for your server.

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

For changes to take effect, you must fully quit the application (not just close the window) and restart it:

macOS: Right-click the Claude icon in the menu bar and select Quit.

Windows: Right-click the Claude icon in the system tray and select Quit.

## Verifying the Connection

Once restarted, look for the tools icon (typically a wrench or hammer symbol) in the bottom right of the message input box.

Click the icon to see a list of available tools discovered from your HasMCP server.

If the server is connected, your tools will be listed under the name you provided (e.g., hasmcp-server).

## Troubleshooting

Logs: Check the logs for connection errors at:

macOS: ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log

Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp.log

Authentication: Ensure your x-hasmcp-key header is correctly formatted with the Bearer prefix.

Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to run the npx command.
