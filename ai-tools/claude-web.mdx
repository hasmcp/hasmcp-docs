# Connecting to Claude Web

You can connect your HasMCP servers to the Claude web application to make your tools available during conversations. This allows Claude to interact with your tools and APIs using the OpenAPI specification provided by HasMCP.

## Setup Instructions

For Claude Apps, HasMCP allows you to pass your access key directly in the URL using a query string, simplifying the configuration process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Token">
    In your HasMCP dashboard, navigate to your **MCP Server** and click **Generate Token** to create a secure access key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Construct the MCP URL">
    Claude requires a base URL for the Apps. Append your token to your server's endpoint using the `token` query parameter.

    On top right of the screen click on **Settings**:

    ```text
    Settings » Apps » Advanced settings » Create app » Enter details below » Create
    ```

    * **Name**: `myServer`
    * **Description**: Your description
    * **MCP Server URL**: `https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>?token=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`
    * **Authentication**: Choose `No Auth` since we passed the token as query string already.

    Click the **Create** button at the bottom of the modal window to activate the MCP Server.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why use Query Strings?

While standard MCP clients use the `x-hasmcp-key` header, using the `?token=<>` query string is ideal for Claude Actions because:

- **Compatibility**: It bypasses potential header-stripping issues in the Claude Action interface.
- **Simplicity**: You do not need to configure an "API Key" in the Claude authentication settings.
- **Security**: The token is still validated by HasMCP before any tools are executed.

    Ensure the `SERVER_ID` in the URL matches the one provided in your
    dashboard.
