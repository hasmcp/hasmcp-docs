# Using MCP in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) through several paths, allowing AI agents to use tools from your HasMCP servers directly in your editor.

## 1. Native Agent Mode (GitHub Copilot)

VS Code's built-in Chat with **Agent Mode** supports remote MCP servers over HTTP.

### Setup

1.  **Generate a Token**: In the HasMCP dashboard, go to your server and click **Generate Token**.
2.  **Add Server**:
    - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    - Type and select **MCP: Add Server**.
    - Choose **HTTP (Http or Server-Sent Events)**.
3.  **Configure**:

    - Enter a name for your server (e.g., `hasmcp-db`).
    - Select **Workspace Settings** to create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file.
    - Enter your HasMCP server URL (e.g., `https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>`).

4.  **Add Authentication**:
    Open the generated `.vscode/mcp.json` and add the `headers` object with your token:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "hasmcp-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>",
      "headers": {
        "x-hasmcp-key": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Extensions (Cline / Roo Code)

Cline and Roo Code are highly capable AI agents for VS Code that support remote MCP servers.

### Setup

Click the MCP icon (a plug or network icon) in the extension's sidebar.

Click Configure MCP Servers or Edit Global Config. This opens the configuration JSON file.

Add your HasMCP server using the Remote MCP (Bridge) format since most local extensions prefer stdio execution:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myServer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>",
        "--header",
        "x-hasmcp-key: Bearer ${HASMCP_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "HASMCP_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verifying Connections

In Native Mode: Open the Chat panel, select Agent Mode, and click the 🛠️ (tools) icon. Your HasMCP server and its tools should appear in the list.

In Extensions: The MCP sidebar tab will show a green status indicator once the server is successfully initialized.

## Troubleshooting

SSE Support: If using native VS Code support, ensure you are on version 1.101 or later for full remote MCP compatibility.

Logs: You can view detailed connection logs by selecting your server in the MCP: List Servers view or checking the Output panel in VS Code.
