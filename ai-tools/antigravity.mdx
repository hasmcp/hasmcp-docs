# Connecting to Google Antigravity

Google Antigravity supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) natively, allowing the editor to securely connect to tools and external services defined in your HasMCP dashboard.

## Setup Instructions

Antigravity manages connections through its built-in **MCP Store**.

### 1. Access the MCP Configuration

1.  Open the **Antigravity Editor**.
2.  Locate the **Agent Panel** in the side panel.
3.  Click the **"..." (three dots) dropdown** at the top of the panel.
4.  Select **Manage MCP Servers**.

### 2. Configure Custom HasMCP Server

1.  In the Manage MCP Servers view, click on **View raw config**.
2.  This will open your `mcp_config.json` file.
3.  Add your HasMCP server to the `mcpServers` object. For remote servers, it is recommended to use the `@hasmcp/remote-mcp` bridge:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myServer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.hasmcp.com/mcp/<SERVER_ID>",
        "--header",
        "x-hasmcp-key: Bearer ${HASMCP_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "HASMCP_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

SERVER_ID: Your unique server identifier from the HasMCP dashboard.

ACCESS_TOKEN: The secure token generated for your server.

### 3. Save and Verify

Save the mcp_config.json file.

The editor will automatically attempt to initialize the connection.

Resources and tools from your HasMCP server will now be available to the AI agent for real-time context and action execution.

## Troubleshooting

Authentication: Ensure your token is valid and the header is correctly prefixed with Bearer.

Node.js Required: Since the connection uses npx, ensure Node.js is installed on your system.

Manual Refresh: If tools do not appear immediately, try toggling the server off and on within the Manage MCP Servers list.
