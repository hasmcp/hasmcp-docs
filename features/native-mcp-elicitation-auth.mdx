description: Discover how HasMCP's Native MCP Elicitation Auth securely handles authentication with protocols like OAuth2 when an LLM needs to use an API on your behalf.

This feature is about solving the complex problem of authentication when an LLM needs to use an API on your behalf. Here's a deeper dive:

- **What it is:** "Elicitation" is a fancy word for "asking for." In the context of MCP, it's a secure way for the system to pause and ask the user for information. "Native MCP Elicitation Auth" means that HasMCP has built-in support for using this "asking" mechanism to handle authentication, specifically with OAuth2.
- **Why it's important:** You can't just give an LLM your username and password. That would be a huge security risk. Instead, modern applications use protocols like OAuth2, where you are redirected to a trusted website (like Google or your corporate login page) to sign in. HasMCP's Elicitation Auth manages this process.
- **How it works:**
  1.  The LLM decides it needs to use a tool that requires you to be logged in.
  2.  HasMCP, acting as the MCP server, detects this and initiates the OAuth2 flow.
  3.  It then "elicits" your permission by providing a secure URL. You, the user, would then click this link, which takes you to the standard login page.
  4.  After you successfully log in, the authentication service sends a secure token back to HasMCP.
  5.  HasMCP can then use this token to make API calls on your behalf.
- **Key benefits:**
  - **Security:** Your credentials are never exposed to the LLM or stored in an insecure way. The process follows industry-standard security protocols.
  - **User Experience:** You get the familiar "Log in with..." experience you're used to in other applications.
  - **Automation:** The process is handled automatically by HasMCP, so developers don't have to build this complex authentication logic themselves.

In short, Native MCP Elicitation Auth is a secure and user-friendly way to handle API authentication in an LLM-powered world, and HasMCP has this capability built-in from the ground up.
