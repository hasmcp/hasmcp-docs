This feature addresses the need for agility and responsiveness in an AI-powered ecosystem. It's about ensuring that the LLM always has an up-to-date understanding of the tools available to it.

- **What it is:** **Real-time Dynamic Tooling** is a capability of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows the list of available tools to change on the fly, without requiring a server restart or manual intervention. HasMCP supports this through the `tool_changed` event.
- **Why it's important:** In a real-world environment, the tools available to an LLM are not static.
  - An API might be temporarily down for maintenance.
  - A new API might be deployed.
  - A user's permissions might change, giving them access to new tools or revoking access to old ones.
  - The structure of an API might change, with new parameters or different return values.
- **How it works:**
  1.  HasMCP continuously monitors the health and status of the APIs it's connected to.
  2.  If it detects a change (e.g., an API goes offline, a new one comes online, or a user's authentication status changes), it sends a `tool_changed` event to the LLM.
  3.  The LLM then knows that it needs to refresh its list of available tools.
  4.  This ensures that the LLM is always working with the most current information.
- **Key benefits:**
  - **Agility:** Your AI agents can adapt to changes in the environment in real-time.
  - **Resilience:** If a tool becomes unavailable, the LLM will know not to use it, preventing errors.
  - **Scalability:** New tools can be added to the system without any downtime.
  - **Security:** If a user's permissions are revoked, their access to tools is immediately cut off.

In essence, Real-time Dynamic Tooling brings a level of dynamism and robustness to LLM-powered applications that is essential for building real-world, production-ready systems.
