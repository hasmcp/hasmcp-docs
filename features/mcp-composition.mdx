MCP Composition is the ability to chain multiple MCP servers together to create more complex and powerful tools.

- **Why it's important:**
  - **Modularity:** MCP Composition allows you to build complex AI systems from smaller, reusable components. This makes your system more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.
  - **Future-Proofing:** As AI systems become more complex, the ability to build modular systems will become increasingly important.

- **How it works:**
  - **MCP Composition:** HasMCP will allow you to define dependencies between MCP servers. For example, you could have one MCP server that provides weather data, and another that provides restaurant recommendations. You could then compose these two servers to create a new tool that recommends restaurants with outdoor seating on sunny days.

- **Key benefits:**
  - **Scalability:** Build complex systems from smaller, reusable components.
  - **Flexibility:** Easily create new tools and workflows by composing existing MCP servers.

In essence, MCP Composition is about building the next generation of AI-powered applications: modular, and scalable.
