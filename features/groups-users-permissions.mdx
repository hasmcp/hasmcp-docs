# Groups, Users, and Permissions for Enterprise

HasMCP Pro/Enterprise offers robust **Groups, Users, and Permissions** features, providing granular control over who can access and manage your MCP servers and tools. This ensures secure collaboration and streamlined operations within your organization.

## Role-Based Access Control

HasMCP Pro/Enterprise comes with predefined roles designed to suit various responsibilities within an organization:

- **Admin**: Full control over all MCP servers, users, and billing within the organization.
- **Developer**: Can create, edit, and manage MCP servers and tools, but typically does not have billing or user management permissions.
- **Analyst**: Primarily has read-only access to server logs and tool usage analytics.
- **Billing Admin**: Manages billing information and subscriptions for the organization.
- **Member**: Basic access, typically limited to using tools they have been granted access to.

## Granular Tool Access

Beyond role-based access, HasMCP allows for highly granular control over individual tools within an MCP server. The owner of an MCP server can:

- **Share Edit Access**: Grant specific users or groups the ability to modify the configuration of specific MCP servers.
- **Share Read Access**: Grant specific users or groups the ability to view the configuration and usage of specific tools, without modification rights.

This level of granularity ensures that:

- Sensitive MCP server configurations can be protected.
- Teams can collaborate on relevant MCP servers without interfering with others.
- Auditing and compliance requirements can be met effectively.

By leveraging these permission settings, enterprise customers can tailor HasMCP to their exact organizational structure and security policies, fostering efficient and secure AI development.
