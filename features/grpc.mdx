gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework for communication between services. It's known for being very fast and efficient.

- **Why it's important for HasMCP:**
  - **Performance:** For real-time applications, the speed of communication between services is critical. gRPC is much faster than traditional REST APIs. HasMCP will soon use gRPC services as the underlying communication protocol for MCP, which will improve performance and efficiency.
  - **Future-Proofing:** As AI systems become more complex, the ability to build high-performance systems will become increasingly important.

- **How it works:**
  - **gRPC as a transport:** HasMCP will use gRPC to communicate with your gRPC enabled services. For MCP still will use REST APIs, which will improve performance and efficiency.

- **Key benefits:**
  - **High Performance:** Build AI systems that can respond in real-time.
