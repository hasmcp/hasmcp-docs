# Audit Logs for Enterprise

HasMCP Enterprise provides **Audit Logs** to give administrators a comprehensive and immutable record of all activities within their organization. This feature is crucial for security, compliance, and operational transparency.

## What are Audit Logs?

Audit logs are chronological records that provide documentary evidence of the sequence of activities that have affected the HasMCP organization at any time. Every action, from a user logging in to a tool being executed, is captured.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Event Tracking**: Logs a wide range of events, including:
  - Changes to users, groups, and permissions.
  - Creation, modification, and deletion of MCP Servers, tools, and other resources.
  - Execution of tools, including the user who initiated the action
  - Changes to billing and subscription settings.

- **Immutability**: Audit logs are designed to be tamper-proof, ensuring the integrity of the records.

- **Search and Filter**: Easily search and filter logs by user, date range, event type, and more, to quickly find the information you need.

- **Export for Compliance**: Export audit logs to common formats (like CSV or JSON) for external review, compliance audits (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001), and integration with external security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

## Use Cases

- **Security Incident Response**: Quickly investigate suspicious activity and understand the scope of any potential security incident.
- **Compliance Audits**: Demonstrate compliance with internal policies and external regulations.
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose issues by reviewing the sequence of events that led to a problem.
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Understand how users are interacting with the platform and enforce accountability.

Audit Logs are an essential feature for any organization that requires a high level of security and control over their AI infrastructure.
