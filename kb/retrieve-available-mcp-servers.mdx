# Retrieving Available MCP Servers

## Using HasMCP UI

![Server List Page](../images/kb/server-list.png)

To view available servers in the UI, log into your HasMCP account and click on **Servers** in the sidebar. This loads a visual dashboard of all servers you have access to.

## Using REST API

Retrieving a list of available MCP servers configured under your HasMCP account programmatically is done through a `GET` request to the `/servers` endpoint.

### Endpoint Reference

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Path**: `/servers`
- **Required Header**: `Authorization: Bearer <Your_Token>`

This endpoint returns a [`ListServersResponse`](/api-reference/servers/list-mcp-servers) payload, which contains an array named `servers`. This array includes all MCP servers that your credentials have access to view, displaying their configurations, linked providers, and general properties.
