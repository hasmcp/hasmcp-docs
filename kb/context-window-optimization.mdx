# Context Window Optimization

**Context Window Optimization** is the process of deliberately truncating, shaping, and transforming raw API outputs into highly dense, semantic payloads specifically tailored for Large Language Model consumption.

Given that all LLMs (like Claude 3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini 1.5) inherently operate under strict token limitations and incur billing charges calculated explicitly via ingested token volume, blindly routing raw `JSON` from enterprise APIs leads directly to:

1. **Context Exhaustion**: Returning a 10,000-line JSON array can immediately exceed the LLM's maximum prompt limits, causing catastrophic orchestration failures.
2. **"Needle in a Haystack" Degradation**: An LLM structurally struggles to find the exact variable it requires when the context is convoluted with useless metadata, null links, and pagination strings.
3. **Explosive Token Costs**: You pay for every byte transmitted to the LLM. 

HasMCP solves this exclusively through its embedded **Data Transformation** pipeline, applying deterministic pruning logic (JMESPath or JS Goja) directly at the gateway before the payload reaches the LLM.
