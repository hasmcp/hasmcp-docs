# Information Returned When Listing MCP Servers

## Using HasMCP UI

![Server List Page](../images/kb/server-list.png)

The dashboard abstracts the raw metadata, displaying the server's name, description, assigned providers, and current status clearly on individual server cards or items.

## Using REST API

When you call the `GET /servers` endpoint, the HasMCP Manager returns a `ListServersResponse` containing an array of `Server` objects. 

### Server Object Schema

For each MCP server in the list, you will receive the following metadata and configuration properties:

- `id` (string): The unique 11-character alphanumeric identifier for the server (e.g., `kSuB9Gf6aD4`).
- `createdAt` (string, date-time): The timestamp when the server was created.
- `updatedAt` (string, date-time): The timestamp when the server was last updated.
- `name` (string): The human-readable name of the server.
- `description` (string): An optional description explaining the server's purpose.
- `requestHeadersProxyEnabled` (boolean): Indicates if header proxying is enabled.
- `version` (integer): The configuration version number.
- `providers` (array): A detailed list of associated providers and their specific OAuth/API configurations.
- `resources` (array): A list of resources linked to this server.
- `prompts` (array): A list of static or dynamic prompts attached to this server.
