# Disassociating Server Prompts

*Note: Visual UI management for Provider Prompts is currently under active development. Utilizing Prompts currently requires the HasMCP REST API.*

To actively sanitize and scale down an agent's orchestration complexity programmatically—such as removing a generalized "v1 Debug Template" in favor of a "v2 Specific Error Template"—you sever the assignment utilizing a destructive state transition endpoint.

## The API Endpoint

**`DELETE /servers/{serverId}/prompts/{promptId}`**

You must explicitly map both the target orchestrator (`serverId`) and the target capability instruction (`promptId`). 

### Utilizing Automation

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers/sE8vKd2qLp9/prompts/mX5vTr9pK2w \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Executing this logic against the proxy causes the HasMCP routing engine to scrub the specific `ServerPrompt` dependency mapping from its relational architecture instantly. Mapped responses return an empty `204 No Content`.

As a direct consequence, the next immediate `prompts/list` Model Context Protocol interrogation originating from downstream connected artificial agents will simply drop the instruction package from the array structure seamlessly.
