# Sharing Tools via Read-Only Access

Yes. If you manage an engineering team that inherently needs to interact with your central Provider Tools (such as triggering an internal Salesforce query or a Jira ticket update) directly via their local IDEs or Desktop LLM Agents smoothly, you can securely configure Read-Only access.

If you want a user to execute tools locally via API but critically block them from viewing the raw upstream connection strings, secret variables, and Javascript Interceptors:

### Configure the Viewer Role

1. Navigate to 'Settings > Members'.
2. Send an email invite to the target user explicitly set as a **Viewer**.
3. The guest generates a Personal Server API Token under their own account.
4. The local LLM exclusively fetches the public JSON schemas (`Name`, `Description`, `Parameters`). The raw REST API logic is natively stripped from their request, guaranteeing perfect isolation.
