# Filtering and Paginating MCP Servers

## Using HasMCP UI

![Server List Page](../images/kb/server-list.png)

When utilizing the HasMCP dashboard, the servers list allows for text-based filtering and visual pagination controls directly within your browser, making it easy to sort through large numbers of servers.

## Using REST API

Currently, according to the standard OpenAPI specification for the HasMCP Manager, the `GET /servers` endpoint returns the complete list of available MCP servers associated with your account in a single response array.

### Details on Parameters

Unlike the `/providers` endpoint (which accepts queries like `limit`, `token`, and `nameContains`), the `/servers` endpoint does not define built-in pagination limits (`limit` or `nextToken`) or filtering query parameters in its schema.

**Note:** The system is designed to return the full array in the `servers` property of the [`ListServersResponse`](/api-reference/servers/list-mcp-servers). If you build automation or UI components on top of this API, it is recommended to implement client-side filtering and pagination of the returned JSON array.
