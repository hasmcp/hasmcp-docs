# Building Modular AI Systems

Traditional AI engineering architectures frequently combine data extraction logic, API authentication keys, and business rules directly into single Python monoliths. This tight coupling makes the system incredibly fragile; updating a Jira API key requires a full deployment of the entire Python orchestration script.

**MCP Composition** shatters this monolithic design.

### Decoupled Microservices

With HasMCP Composition, you effectively treat external APIs as isolated microservices. 

1. **Isolation**: Your GitHub MCP server runs independently of your Postgres MCP server.
2. **Modular Interfaces**: In the HasMCP dashboard, you construct a generic "EngineeringTools" Interface.
3. **Dynamic Hot-Swapping**: If your organization migrates from Postgres to MySQL, you simply disconnect the Postgres server inside the Interface and connect the new MySQL server.

Because your local Desktop LLM only connects to the generic `EngineeringTools` interface endpoint, the transition happens instantaneously. The developer never has to update their local `claude_desktop_config.json`, rebuild their Docker image, or restart their desktop client.
