# Real-time Dynamic Tooling

In traditional Model Context Protocol architecture, whenever you update your internal Python service to add a new `deleteCustomer` tool, every engineer in your company must completely reboot their Claude Desktop application for the LLM to fetch the `tools/list` API and discover the new function.

This creates extreme friction and version skew across developer environments.

HasMCP fundamentally eliminates this overhead.

### The HasMCP Advantage
1. Ten developers have Claude Desktop actively open, carrying on conversations with their agents. They are connected to a unified HasMCP `coreEngineering` Interface.
2. A platform admin constructs a new `deleteCustomer` tool using a REST API integration in the HasMCP UI.
3. They drag and drop that new tool onto the `coreEngineering` Interface.
4. The HasMCP Proxy Server immediately fires a `tools/changed` notification across the 10 open SSE (MCP Streamable HTTP) streams concurrently.
5. Behind the scenes, the 10 active Claude Desktop instances silently re-fetch the updated tool schema from HasMCP.

The human developers do not have to restart anything. They can instantly prompt Claude: "Analyze the RAM on Server B" and the LLM will successfully access the tool that was deployed precisely 4 seconds prior.
