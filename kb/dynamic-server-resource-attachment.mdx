title: Can I dynamically attach and detach resources from a running server API?

# Dynamic Resource Attachments

**Yes**. Because you are deploying HasMCP as a central orchestration bridge rather than hard-coding tools statically into isolated `app.ts` agent scripts, you achieve true mutability.

## Live Context Swapping

You can arbitrarily execute `POST /servers/{serverId}/resources` or `DELETE /servers/{serverId}/resources/{resourceId}` operations via your infrastructure pipelines natively *while* an agent is actively conversing with a user or executing a system loop.

### Real-world AI Feedback Loops

Because connecting clients supporting the Model Context Protocol routinely process `notifications/resources/list_changed` notifications:

1. An agent is analyzing a log file but throwing a generic `Permission Denied` HTTP error for a sub-service it doesn't currently possess resource access to.
2. A secondary "Orchestration Script" catches the error loop on the terminal.
3. The Orchestrator fires an authenticated REST API capability `POST` to HasMCP, dynamically mapping the secondary database schema resource down to the active agent.
4. HasMCP triggers the internal Model Context Protocol invalidation logic. 
5. The local LLM client immediately polls the updated capability set, acknowledges the new database schema resource, and self-corrects its diagnostic loop natively.

This decoupled, remote management fundamentally enables complex self-healing operational infrastructures.
