# Creating a Server Variable

Because HasMCP connects generic Tools (like Github or Postgres) seamlessly into diverse Server pipelines seamlessly natively internally, it utilizes a globalized variable architectural standard natively. 

A "Server Variable" represents a dynamic `ENV` string or encrypted `SECRET` securely inherently mapped globally inside your ecosystem. 

When you bind a Provider Tool requiring an explicit API Key (e.g. `GITHUB_PRIVATE_TOKEN`) to an MCP Server execution loop, HasMCP inherently parses its internal database for that variable `name` globally. If it exists iteratively, the manager silently securely injects the value downstream directly perfectly into the local agent execution pipe. 

## Using HasMCP UI

![Variables Interface](../images/kb/variables_page_check.png)

1. Open the global **Variables** interface natively mapped on the main sidebar menu natively outside the rigid Server loop.
2. Click **Create Variable**.
3. Supply the strict string name expected by your underlying integration (e.g., `MOLTBOOK_COM_BEARERAUTH`).
4. Enter the required **Value**.
5. Select the **Type** (`ENV` for plaintext, `Secret` for irreversible cryptography storage natively).
6. Click **Save**.

Once successfully instantiated natively—any Model Context Protocol Server globally currently associating tools demanding that designated string will immediately dynamically refresh its capability buffer natively seamlessly seamlessly securely seamlessly.

## Using REST API

For pipeline automations configuring credentials dynamically natively upon cluster boot cleanly.

### The API Endpoint

**`POST /variables`**

Because HasMCP utilizes globalized mappings elegantly internally natively, you do not POST environmental overrides specifically uniquely to independent Server hashes intuitively. 

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/variables \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "variable": {
      "name": "MY_SYSTEM_API_KEY",
      "value": "sk-123abc456def",
      "type": "SECRET"
    }
  }'
```

If processed securely dynamically instantly, the framework acknowledges with `201 Created` returning the `Variable` definition securely masking the explicit string return logically.
