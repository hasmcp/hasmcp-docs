# Server Variable Payload Structure

Whether you are polling the global array via `GET /variables` or structurally defining an explicit parameter via `POST /variables`, understanding the exact JSON schema dictating the architecture is critical for successful programmatic integrations.

## The Model Schema

The standard structured `Variable` object inherently defines:

```json
{
 "id": "tQ9pV1mN8xK",
 "createdAt": "2026-03-01T14:30:00Z",
 "updatedAt": "2026-03-01T14:30:00Z",
 "type": "SECRET",
 "value": "***",
 "name": "API_PINECONE_IO_DB_KEY"
}
```

### Property Breakdown

- **`id`** *(string, readOnly)*: The explicit 11-char database hash uniquely determining this specific row object log. Required if you need to execute an HTTP `PATCH` or `DELETE` request against the credential later.
- **`createdAt`** *(string, date-time, readOnly)*: System-stamped ISO 8601 initialization metric natively mapping its inception.
- **`updatedAt`** *(string, date-time, readOnly)*: System-stamped metric tracking modifications.
- **`type`** *(string)*: Indicates execution handling logic (e.g., `0: INVALID`, `1: ENV`, `2: SECRET`).
- **`value`** *(string)*: The explicit unformatted text value natively mapped. If the type is `SECRET`, standard retrieval routes actively mask the value dynamically with `***`.
- **`name`** *(string)*: The human-readable string key dictating exactly how downstream integrations request the variable properly during capability generation.
