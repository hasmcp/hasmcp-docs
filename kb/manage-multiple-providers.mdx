# Managing Multiple API Providers

## Using HasMCP UI

![Providers List Page](../images/kb/providers-list.png)

Yes! At its core, the HasMCP system is built not just to abstract a *single* REST API connection, but to act as a universal, centralized catalog unifying dozens of distinct internal and external APIs.

## How HasMCP Integrates Multiple Providers

Rather than forcing AI clients to individually grasp the disparate logic, authentication requirements, and rate limits spanning Google, Stripe, Slack, and your internal Microservices, HasMCP aggregates them in one place.

### The "N:M" Attachment Model

- **Multiple Providers:** You can register as many distinct `Providers` as your application portfolio requires (via `/providers`).
- **Granular Attachments:** You decouple these capabilities from single servers. When you build a new `Server` configured for a niche agent (e.g., An "HR Onboarding Assistant"), you merely **attach** the specific, individual tools from your catalog of providers to that server map securely.

This many-to-many architecture drastically simplifies operations. Update a base URL for a Provider *once*, and all 50 Agent implementations traversing MCP natively adopt the new endpoint without individual recompilation.
