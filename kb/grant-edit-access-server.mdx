# Granular Server Permission Scoping

Currently, HasMCP strictly enforces Role-Based Access Control exclusively at the explicit **Workspace Level**.

This means that if you promote an invited user to the **Developer** role, they explicitly inherit universal edit access across *all* Provider Tools and Variables explicitly deployed into that specific Workspace.

### Achieving Granular Isolation

If your modern architecture strictly mandates that "Developer A" exclusively possesses edit capabilities for `Staging_LLM_Server`, but cannot possibly manipulate `Production_Analytics_Server`, you must physically isolate them.

Currently, HasMCP does not provide item-level granular RBAC internally. To achieve component-level isolation reliably:

1. Create a brand new independent **Workspace** strictly for "Production Analytics".
2. Migrate the Production infrastructure.
3. Exclusively invite the developers explicitly authorized to modify that production architecture to the new isolated workspace.
