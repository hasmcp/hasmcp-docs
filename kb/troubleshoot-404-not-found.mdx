# Troubleshooting a 404 Not Found

A `404 Not Found` explicitly dictates that the specific structural resource you requested entirely does not exist inside the HasMCP database.

## Common Causes

This typically occurs when targeting explicit entity definitions:

1. **Deleted Resources**: Attempting `GET /providers/w3D5t8` after another administrator successfully executed `DELETE /providers/w3D5t8`.
2. **Typographical Hashes**: Hand-typing an 11-character target ID (e.g. `PATCH /variables/x7T4...`) and transposing explicit characters.
3. **Misconfigured Routing**: Posting structurally to `POST /server` (invalid definition) instead of `POST /servers` correctly.

## Resolution Steps

1. **List Endpoints First**: Before querying a targeted ID, explicitly execute `GET /providers` or `GET /variables` to confirm the required ID definitively returns in the live array.
2. **Verify Base Routing**: Double-check the core HasMCP OpenAPI schema ensuring the specific namespace correctly includes an `s` organically if mapping an array (e.g. `/servers/{id}`).
3. **Dashboard Audits**: If a previously functioning execution suddenly returns a `404`, check the organizational dashboard to confirm if the configuration was historically purged by another engineer.
