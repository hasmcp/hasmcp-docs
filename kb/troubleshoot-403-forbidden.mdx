# Troubleshooting a 403 Forbidden

Unlike a `401 Unauthorized` (where your identity is completely unknown), a `403 Forbidden` confirms that HasMCP understands exactly who you are, but you definitively lack the internal permissions to execute the specific action.

## Common Causes

This response strictly maps to structural permission violations inside your organization's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) definitions:

1. **Scope Violations**: Modifying a specific Provider schema you only have "Read" access to.
2. **Organizational Strictures**: Attempting to delete a Global Server Variable explicitly managed by an Organization Owner while you act as a Standard Member.
3. **Restricted Server Executions**: Utilizing a Server Token specifically bound to "Server A" to attempt a deletion action on a resource attached strictly to "Server B".

## Resolution Steps

1. **Verify Role Scopes**: Check with your Organization Owner to confirm whether your specific user profile actively possesses Write or Delete privileges for the target item.
2. **Validate Bound Tokens**: Ensure the exact Server Token driving the integration fundamentally belongs to the Server environment you are interacting with.
3. **Review Audit Logs**: The HasMCP dashboard cleanly logs all `403 Forbidden` blocks. Filtering these logs explicitly determines the required privilege scope you are currently lacking.
