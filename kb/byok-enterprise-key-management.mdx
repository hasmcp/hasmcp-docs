# Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Yes. For Enterprise deployments on the Dedicated tier, you can strictly govern your cryptographic boundaries using **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**.

While standard HasMCP clustered infrastructure utilizes a secure, randomly generated local AES-256-GCM configuration natively, Enterprise clients often have rigid compliance mandates requiring custom key ingestion.

### How BYOK Integration Works
When deploying your Enterprise instance, you can provide an independent, 256-bit (32-byte) hex-encoded cryptography string directly to the proxy engine via your configuration management pipeline.

1. HasMCP securely ingests your provided `EncryptionKey` string into isolated vault memory.
2. Every external Provider Secret, API Token, and Database Connection String you save into HasMCP is now explicitly encrypted using your specific ingestion key.
3. If your organization detects a critical security breach internally, your administrators can instantly rotate or drop the custom string directly from your infrastructure orchestration.
4. The moment the key is revoked, the HasMCP execution proxy permanently loses the structural decryption capability, instantly terminating all automated LLM connections immediately across your entire organization.
