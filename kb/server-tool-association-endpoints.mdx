# Defining the Tool Association Endpoint

The core mechanism for extending an MCP server's execution capabilities is securely linking it to pre-defined Provider Tools.

## The API Endpoint

To authorize new tool access for a specific server, use the highly specific `POST` routing path built around the server's unique identifier.

**`POST /servers/{serverId}/tools`**

- `{serverId}` dictates the 11-character hash indicating the specific agent environment. 

### Structuring the Association

Because tools belong to specific API integrations, the `CreateServerToolRequest` mandates passing an object defining the entire triangular relationship. You cannot simply pass the tool ID; you must also declare `providerID` and `serverID` inside the payload object.

```json
{
 "tool": {
 "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
 "providerID": "kSuB9Gf6aD4",
 "toolID": "tH4mZw9xV2n"
 }
}
```

### Successful Response

The command yields `200 OK` upon success, replying with the mapped `CreateServerToolResponse` object. The server immediately begins reporting this new tool structure in its `ListTools` protocol handler to downstream LLM inferences.
