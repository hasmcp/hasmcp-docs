# Payload for Server Resource Mapping

Unlike Tools—which require extremely rigid triangular definitions mapping `providerID`, `toolID`, and `serverID` simultaneously—Resource definitions rely solely on a dual identifier model.

## The Minimal Path

When defining a link physically through a `POST /servers/{serverId}/resources` request, HasMCP utilizes an abstracted lookup mechanism based upon the `resourceID` provided. Because every created object on the platform resolves to an explicit ID hash (guaranteeing uniqueness), the system implicitly derives the Provider origin via a subquery.

### Required Fields

For the [`CreateServerResourceRequest`](/api-reference/servers/resources/create-mcp-server-resource-association):

- **`serverID`** *(string)*: The 11-character hash establishing the recipient MCP environment acting as the unified gateway for LLMs. This value must mirror the `{serverId}` deployed in your URL pathing.
- **`resourceID`** *(string)*: The precise 11-character identifier locked onto the specific piece of data mapping.

### Example Construction

```json
{
 "resource": {
 "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
 "resourceID": "rA9BdO1kZ5T"
 }
}
```

By ensuring your automation pipelines pass these two distinct properties accurately in the JSON mapping tree, HasMCP flawlessly associates the data exposure automatically securely without further abstraction requirements.
