# Modifying Outgoing HTTP Headers

Yes. Because everything generated by the LLM natively routes through the central HasMCP execution proxy, you have infinite, programmatic control over the raw HTTP protocol headers transmitted to your external APIs and internal databases.

### Static Header Injection
For simplistic systems, you can define **Static Headers** directly within your Provider configuration console.
If a legacy SOAP endpoint implicitly requires an `x-company-tenant-id` header to route requests, you can permanently inject that static string onto every single HTTP outbound request initiated by the target Provider Tool.

### Dynamic Header Proxying

HasMCP currently does **not** allow modifying outgoing request headers using JavaScript interceptors.

However, HasMCP natively allows proxying headers coming directly from the LLM client (such as Claude Desktop or your custom agent) through to the upstream API. If the LLM client injects specific HTTP headers into the MCP execution payload, the proxy will securely forward those designated headers to your configured Provider endpoint.

This ensures legacy networks, corporate CDNs, and rigid WAF firewalls receive the necessary network structures transmitted by your agent architecture.
