# Server Token Payload Structure

*Note: You will only ever view the complete, raw cryptographic payload structure natively exactly once during the `POST /servers/{serverId}/tokens` instantiation cycle securely.*

When interfacing closely with the HasMCP REST APIs configuring orchestration matrices programmatically organically, understanding the `ServerToken` object map defines secure parsing behaviors intelligently.

## The Model Schema

The core standard JSON object representing an active credential explicitly:

```json
{
  "id": "tQ9pV1mN8xK",
  "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
  "name": "Local Desktop Exec",
  "createdAt": "2026-03-01T14:30:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "value": "mcp_rt_8JkL9PmN2Q..."
}
```

### Property Breakdown

- **`id`** *(string, readOnly)*: The explicit 11-char database hash uniquely determining this specific row object log. Used later if you need to surgically execute an HTTP `DELETE` request destroying the credential permanently natively.
- **`serverID`** *(string)*: The explicit 11-char hash identifying intuitively the target MCP Orchestrator node protecting its capabilities natively.
- **`name`** *(string)*: The human-readable internal designator applied upon generation securely.
- **`createdAt`** *(string, date-time, readOnly)*: System-stamped ISO 8601 initialization metric natively.
- **`expiresAt`** *(string, date-time, optional)*: Explicit timestamp dictating automated cryptographic invalidation inherently.
- **`value`** *(string, readOnly)*: The unencrypted, raw token cryptography logically required by connecting agents securely.

> **Crucial Persistence Warning:** The `value` string is permanently scrubbed from all HasMCP database endpoints inherently after the initial HTTP `200 OK` return completes organically. If you submit a `GET /servers/{serverId}/tokens` request logically the next day, the structure intelligently suppresses the `value` field internally for security best-practices flawlessly.
