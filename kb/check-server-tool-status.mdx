# Multi-Provider Tool Composition

## Building Composite AI Systems

**Yes, absolutely.** The core architectural value proposition of HasMCP's routing engine lies in its ability to **composite tools across disparate API Providers** and unify them into a single, cohesive Model Context Protocol server block.

### Unifying Capabilities 

In standard Model Context Protocol setups, managing connections to disparate domain tools (e.g., GitHub, Jira, and internal custom databases) requires instantiating separate servers for every isolated environment.

**With HasMCP, you only need one Server.**

When configuring an MCP server in the HasMCP dashboard (or programmatically via API), you can selectively bind Tools originating from completely unrelated Providers into a single agent topology.

1. **Jira Provider**: Pull down the `Search_Tickets` tool and map it to `Server A`.
2. **GitHub Provider**: Pull down the `List_PRs` tool and map it to `Server A`.

`Server A` securely brokers authentication dynamically in the background for both tools.

## The API Mechanism

Because the `CreateServerToolRequest` specifically mandates explicitly defining independent `{providerID}` fields alongside `{serverID}` mappings, a single server handles heterogeneous routing inherently. 

```json
{
 "tool": {
 "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
 "providerID": "kSuB9Gf6aD4", // E.g., The GitHub Provider
 "toolID": "tH4mZw9xV2n" 
 }
}
```

```json
{
 "tool": {
 "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
 "providerID": "pZ1xQw3eR4t", // E.g., The Jira Provider
 "toolID": "aB8cV5nXm0q"
 }
}
```

When an LLM prompts `serverA` with `tools/list`, HasMCP aggressively compiles both `searchTickets` and `listPRs` into a single homogenous instruction block, abstracting the complexities of discrete integrations away from your context window entirely.
