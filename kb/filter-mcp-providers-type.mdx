# Filtering Providers by API Type

## Using HasMCP UI

![Providers List Page](../images/kb/providers-list.png)

While the dashboard provides search capabilities, filtering strictly by API architecture (`REST` vs native integrations) is primarily handled at the data API level if you are building external integrations.

## Using REST API

If you need to retrieve a list of providers conforming only to a specific architecture (e.g., separating REST APIs from other future API types), you can pass an exact match query parameter to the `/providers` endpoint.

### The `apiType` Filter

By appending the `apiType` URL query parameter to your `GET` request, HasMCP will filter the response array to only include providers whose `apiType` string matches exactly.

#### Execution Example

To find all REST-based API providers:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/providers?apiType=REST' \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

*Note: Currently, HasMCP strongly focuses on the `REST` API type, but this parameter allows structural querying in mixed API environments.*
