# MCP Telemetry 

When deploying autonomous AI agents, visibility is critical. Because HasMCP acts as the central gateway between your LLMs and your backend APIs, it provides deep, native telemetry into the Model Context Protocol (MCP) data flow.

Here are the most common questions about monitoring your agents:

* [What visibility does HasMCP provide into AI agent data flow?](/kb/ai-agent-data-flow-visibility)
* [How can I view Tool Call Analytics to see my most frequently used tools?](/kb/view-tool-call-analytics)
* [How do I track per-user or agent tool usage for billing and quotas?](/kb/per-user-tool-usage-tracking)
* [How can I monitor token economics and cost savings?](/kb/monitor-token-economics-savings)
* [How do I use the Streaming Debug Console to troubleshoot requests in real-time?](/kb/streaming-debug-console)
* [How do I use the Payload Inspector to trace data transformations?](/kb/payload-inspector-data-transformations)
