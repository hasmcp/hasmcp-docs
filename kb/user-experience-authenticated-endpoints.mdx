# User Experience for Authentication

The user experience natively orchestrated by HasMCP guarantees complete immersion. A human communicating with Claude or Cursor does not need to open external tabs, navigate complicated developer portals, or generate manual API keys.

### The Flow
1. **The Prompt**: The user asks Claude natively: "Review recent Jira bug tickets."
2. **The Execution**: Claude decides to use the configured Jira Provider Tool.
3. **The Pause**: HasMCP detects missing authentication for that specific session.
4. **The Interruption**: Claude visually pauses text generation natively. An authorization button appears directly inside the chat interface.
5. **The Login**: The user clicks the button seamlessly. A secure, fully managed HasMCP graphical prompt appears allowing them to correctly input their API key, or transparently complete the required OAuth sequence.
6. **The Continuation**: Claude receives the success payload and instantly resumes the conversational workflow.
