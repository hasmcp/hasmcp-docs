# Checking MCP Server Status and Configuration

## Using HasMCP UI

The easiest way to check a server's configuration is to open its details page in the HasMCP dashboard. The UI will show you the configured name, instructions, and list all active provider and tool mappings.

## Using REST API

To check the current configuration and inferred status of an MCP server programmatically, you should utilize the `GET /servers/{id}` endpoint.

### Reading the Configuration

When you retrieve the server details, you receive a comprehensive JSON object representing its current state in the HasMCP platform:

- **Configuration Verification**: Inspect the `providers`, `tools`, `resources`, and `prompts` arrays to guarantee that the server has all the capabilities you expect.
- **Version Checking**: Look at the `version` integer and the `updatedAt` timestamp to confirm if your most recent updates (`PATCH` requests) have been successfully applied.
- **Proxy Status**: Check the `requestHeadersProxyEnabled` boolean to verify your proxy security configuration.

By polling `GET /servers/{id}`, developers can confirm deployment workflows are successful and assure their agent pipelines are connected to the most up-to-date environments.
