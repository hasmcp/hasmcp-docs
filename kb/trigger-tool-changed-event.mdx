# Triggering 'tool_changed' Events

The Model Context Protocol establishes a standard contract for servers to inform authorized clients about schema updates securely. HasMCP adheres to this convention rigidly.

### Administrative Triggers

By default, any of the following administrative operations inside the HasMCP platform will instantly synthesize and broadcast a `notifications/tools/list_changed` JSON-RPC SSE (MCP Streamable HTTP) payload dynamically to all securely authenticated, connected AI Agents:

1. **Creating a Tool**: An administrator saves a fresh Provider Tool mapping natively to Postgres or Salesforce natively.
2. **Deleting a Target**: A security engineer revokes access to a legacy Customer Analytics database.
3. **Modifying an Argument**: A developer adds a new required `email_address` string property to the JSON Schema of an existing user-search tool.
4. **Altering Tool Descriptions**: A prompt engineer edits the explicit semantic description of a Jira query endpoint to prevent the AI from incorrectly calling it during bug hunts explicitly.

Every time these boundaries are altered effectively by human admins, the execution cluster broadcasts the delta to the Desktop proxies, prompting immediate cache invalidations securely.
