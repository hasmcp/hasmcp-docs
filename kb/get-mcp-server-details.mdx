# Getting Specific MCP Server Details

## Using HasMCP UI

To view the details of a specific server in the dashboard:
1. Navigate to the **Servers** list.
2. Click on the card or row of the server you wish to inspect.
3. The dashboard will display the server's full configuration, including its assigned providers, connected endpoints, and active prompts.

## Using REST API

To retrieve the full details of a specific MCP server programmatically, you must use its unique alphanumeric ID and make a querying `GET` request to the HasMCP Manager API.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Obtain the Server ID**: Find the 11-character ID of the server (e.g., `kSuB9Gf6aD4`), usually retrieved from the `GET /servers` list endpoint.
2. **Make the API Call**: Send a `GET` request to `/servers/{id}`.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers/kSuB9Gf6aD4 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

The response returns a `200 OK` status with a `GetServerResponse` object. This object contains a single `server` property with all nested configurations, providers, resources, and prompts fully populated.
