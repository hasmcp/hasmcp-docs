# Removing and Replacing PII Fields with Goja

Yes. Because Goja provides a complete functional JavaScript execution context organically, you can iterate deep into nested structural properties to selectively trigger `delete` mechanisms or rewrite strings securely.

### Completely Deleting Fields
If you need to destroy a node outright inside JS :

```javascript
if (input.medical_records) {
  // This physically removes the object perfectly
  delete input.medical_records;
}

return input;
```

### Advanced Conditional Masking

Sometimes, an LLM orchestration prompt depends on a specific key existing in the JSON payload, so deleting it outright will break the agent. In these cases, you can inject explicit synthetic mock values functionally:

```javascript
for(var i=0; i<input.length; i++) {
  if(input[i].email) {
    // Replace real email with a deterministic synthetic string
    input[i].email = "user_" + input[i].id + "@redacted.local";
  }
}

return input;
```

This procedure flawlessly transforms the outbound REST payload.
