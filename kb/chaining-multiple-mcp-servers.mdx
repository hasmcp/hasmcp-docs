# Chaining Multiple MCP Servers

Yes, HasMCP fundamentally supports chaining dozens of highly specific Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugins together into a unified orchestration hub.

Yes, HasMCP fundamentally supports chaining dozens of distinct Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers together into a unified orchestration hub.

### The Problem with Single Tool Loading
If you want to build an AI agent that investigates a customer bug ticket, the agent needs to:
1. Search Jira for the ticket description.
2. Query Postgres for the customer's payment status.
3. Access Slack to message the internal engineering team.

Loading these three separate MCP servers manually into Claude Desktop creates immense configuration overhead.

Loading these three separate MCP servers manually into Claude Desktop creates immense configuration overhead natively.

### The Composition Solution
Instead, you implement server chaining visually within the HasMCP dashboard.

1. You securely authenticate the Jira, Postgres, and Slack Provider tools.
2. You generate an **Interface** called `Customer_Success_Workflow`.
3. You link all three disparate servers.

3. You link all three providers into the `Customer_Success_Workflow` Interface.

3. You map all three providers into the `Customer_Success_Workflow` Interface securely.

When the LLM connects to the unique SSE (MCP Streamable HTTP) stream assigned to `Customer_Success_Workflow`, the proxy intelligently merges the schemas.

When the LLM connects to the unique SSE (MCP Streamable HTTP) stream assigned to `Customer_Success_Workflow`, HasMCP dynamically injects the JSON parameters of all three tools into the LLM's context window simultaneously. 

The LLM genuinely believes it is talking to a single omnipotent backend.
