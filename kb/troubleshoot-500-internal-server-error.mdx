# Troubleshooting a 500 Internal Server Error

A `500 Internal Server Error` systematically indicates an unexpected, fatal exception specifically occurred inside the HasMCP core proxy framework. This differs significantly from local 400-series errors as the request fundamentally formatted.

## Common Causes

1. **Proxy Connection Drop**: HasMCP successfully parses the execution but fundamentally fails to connect to the underlying third-party Provider API (e.g. Github goes down).
2. **Internal Timelines**: A severe configuration loop causes an internal timeout physically explicitly within the HasMCP cluster.
3. **Database Maintenance**: Temporary execution stalls while the core cluster scales.

## Resolution Steps

1. **Wait and Retry**: Standard 500 errors clear.
2. **Check Operational Status**: Reference the master status dashboard.
3. **Audit Underlying Providers**: In 95% of cases , the physical 3rd-party integration natively dropped.
