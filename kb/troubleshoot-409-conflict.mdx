# Troubleshooting a 409 Conflict

A `409 Conflict` typically responds when an execution cleanly attempts to fundamentally process structural modifications that actively violate a fixed database condition seamlessly. 

In HasMCP, this heavily correlates with mapping bindings (like servers to tools, prompts, or resources) that already exist.

## Common Causes

1. **Duplicate Server-Tool Associations**: Attempting to execute `POST /servers/{serverId}/tools` to link a tool that has already been linked.
2. **Duplicate Server-Prompt Associations**: Attempting to execute `POST /servers/{serverId}/prompts` for an already existing prompt association.
3. **Duplicate Server-Resource Associations**: Attempting to execute `POST /servers/{serverId}/resources` for an already existing resource association.

## Resolution Steps

1. **Check Existing Maps**: Before issuing `POST` mapping definitions, `GET` the current list to confirm it hasn't been mapped natively yet.
2. **Use Correct Tools**: A 409 means the LLM or script was trying to append a capability the Server already physically holds.
