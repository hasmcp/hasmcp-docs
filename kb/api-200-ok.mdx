title: What does a 200 OK status code mean?
description: HasMCP standard HTTP status codes overview for successful requests.

# 200 OK

A `200 OK` HTTP status essentially confirms that the HasMCP server cleanly received, understood, and successfully processed your explicit request logically. 

In the HasMCP architecture, `200 OK` is exclusively returned when executing:

- **`GET` Operations**: Returning a specific single object payload (like a specific Server dictionary) or returning a paginated `List` response logically.
- **`PATCH` Operations**: Confirming that a partial update action cleanly modified the object and returning the modified object natively in the response body.

If an endpoint returns `200 OK`, your systematic integration effectively succeeded.
