# Immutable Audit Logs

Yes. HasMCP Enterprise strictly enforces a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) paradigm for the global event ledger.

Neither standard administrators nor enterprise super-admins can modify, mutate, edit, or delete events written to the Audit Log database. Once an action converts to a serialized event, it is cryptographically locked into the interface.

### Data Retention
By default, Enterprise accounts feature a trailing **90-day** immutable retention window. Historical payloads past this timeframe are structurally purged to manage index sizing.

If you require multi-year compliance archiving for regulatory adherence, you must explicitly stream these events out of HasMCP natively into external long-term storage solutions.
