# Filtering Audit Logs

When investigating complex orchestration failures or compliance violations, parsing thousands of log entries manually is impossible. HasMCP Enterprise provides a robust query interface to isolate specific events.

### Available Filters

Navigating to **Settings &rarr; Audit Logs**, you can leverage the following query parameters:

1. **Date Ranges**: Isolate events to a specific week, month, or custom `startDate` and `endDate` boundary.
2. **Event Type**: Filter the specific schema namespace (e.g. exclusively querying `server.created` or `token.revoked`).
3. **Actor / Identity**: Search using the authenticated user's email address or the specific ID of the MCP Client token to trace exactly what an independent agent executed.
4. **Resource ID**: Target investigations by inputting the explicit Provider ID or Server ID to view an isolated lifeline of all historical configuration changes.
