# Listing Associated Server Prompts

*Note: Visual UI management for Provider Prompts is currently under active development. Utilizing Prompts currently requires the HasMCP REST API.*

To understand which conversational templates and logic matrices are actively exposed via standard MCP translation logic to your localized LLMs, you can interrogate the Server abstraction programmatically.

## Using REST API

Instead of querying the Model Context Protocol stdio client loop, backend engineers can simply verify the HasMCP orchestration database natively.

### The API Endpoint

**`GET /servers/{serverId}/prompts`**

Executing a GET query against this unified directory path triggers HasMCP to output an aggregate `ListServerPromptsResponse`.

### Using Curl

```bash
curl -X GET https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers/sE8vKd2qLp9/prompts \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

The response is packaged as a `prompts` array dictionary, detailing every explicit assignment loop mapped securely to the designated agent runtime environment.

```json
{
 "prompts": [
 {
 "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
 "promptID": "mX5vTr9pK2w"
 },
 {
 "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
 "promptID": "aL2mZq8yV1t"
 }
 ]
}
```
