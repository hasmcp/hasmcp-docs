# Enterprise Audit Logs

Available natively in HasMCP Enterprise, the **Audit Logs** system acts as an immutable, real-time ledger recording every definitive state change, execution event, and authentication request within your organization's environment.

This feature is explicitly designed for compliance officers, security teams, and platform administrators who require high-fidelity visibility into agent integrations natively.

### What is Recorded?
Audit logs capture comprehensive context natively:
* **Who**: The user ID, email, or MCP client token that initiated the action.
* **What**: The exact action performed (e.g. `server.created`, `tool.executed`, `variable.decrypted`).
* **When**: A precise, immutable UTC timestamp.
* **Where**: The originating IP address and user-agent.
* **Target**: The specific resource, server, or provider affected by the event.

You can view the full ledger directly through the HasMCP dashboard under **Settings &rarr; Audit Logs**.
