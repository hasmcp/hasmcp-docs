# Associating a Resource to an MCP Server

## Using HasMCP UI

While tools execute actions, **Resources** expose static or dynamic read-only data blobs (like log files, system statuses, or raw configuration data) to your AI Agents. 

To authorize a server to read a specific resource:
1. Navigate to the **MCP Servers** layout in your HasMCP dashboard.
2. Click into your target server.
3. Select the **Resources** tab.
4. Click **Add Resource**.
5. Select the Provider that houses the data, and pick the specific Resource you want to expose.
6. Click **Confirm** to lock the association. The server will immediately index the new URI in its routing table.

## Using REST API

To programmatically map an active data resource to a running container execution environment, utilize the server's routed `POST` resource endpoint.

### The API Endpoint

**`POST /servers/{serverId}/resources`**

### Building the Request

Unlike Tools (which require identifying the Provider directly in the payload), the `CreateServerResourceRequest` object is streamlined. You only need to declare the Server receiving access, and the unique ID of the specific Resource.

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers/sE8vKd2qLp9/resources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource": {
      "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
      "resourceID": "rA9BdO1kZ5T"
    }
  }'
```

The system will synchronously grant cross-boundary access and reply with a `200 OK` housing the successfully validated `resource` JSON object.
