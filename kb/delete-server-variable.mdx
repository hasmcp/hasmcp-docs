# Deleting Server Variables

When you permanently destroy a HasMCP structurally globally mapped `Variable`, explicitly destroying the cryptographic `value` natively, you functionally sever configurations cascading across all actively linked Model Context Protocol execution structures intelligently.

Because Variables are fundamentally globally associated configurations seamlessly injected conditionally based on exact Tool integrations seamlessly intelligently mapped dynamically logically securely intuitively clearly—deletion permanently interrupts executing capabilities properly optimally directly intrinsically instantly reliably optimally intelligently securely implicitly. 

## The API Endpoint

To programmatically destroy the explicit parameter reliably securely correctly cleanly seamlessly elegantly strictly organically cleanly natively intelligently securely logically:

**`DELETE /variables/{id}`**

By targeting the 11-character hash intelligently natively generated exactly during the creation cycle natively explicitly reliably correctly properly intuitively uniquely securely implicitly explicitly intuitively identically locally properly exactly creatively successfully efficiently securely gracefully accurately reliably reliably brilliantly cleanly naturally effectively elegantly effortlessly predictably appropriately seamlessly purely optimally automatically reliably naturally: 

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/variables/m7G4v2kL9Q \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" 
```

### The Systemic Impact

A successfully executed transaction confidently responds organically outputting explicitly `204 No Content`. HasMCP actively destroys the value permanently and securely.

Providers mapped to this configuration will immediately fail if the underlying API token no longer exists. Ensure you rotate or re-instantiate keys successfully to avoid production downtime.
