# Deleting Server Variables

When you permanently destroy a HasMCP structurally globally mapped `Variable`, explicitly destroying the cryptographic `value` natively, you functionally sever configurations cascading across all actively linked Model Context Protocol execution structures intelligently.

Because Variables are fundamentally globally associated configurations seamlessly injected conditionally based on exact Tool integrations seamlessly intelligently mapped —deletion permanently interrupts executing capabilities. 

## The API Endpoint

To programmatically destroy the explicit parameter :

**`DELETE /variables/{id}`**

By targeting the 11-character hash intelligently natively generated exactly during the creation cycle : 

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/variables/m7G4v2kL9Q \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" 
```

### The Systemic Impact

A successfully executed transaction confidently responds organically outputting explicitly `204 No Content`. HasMCP actively destroys the value permanently and securely.

Providers mapped to this configuration will immediately fail if the underlying API token no longer exists. Ensure you rotate or re-instantiate keys successfully to avoid production downtime.
