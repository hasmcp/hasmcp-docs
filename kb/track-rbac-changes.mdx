# Tracking RBAC Changes

HasMCP Enterprise automatically records all identity and access management operations directly into the immutable Audit Logs.

Whenever an administrator alters the RBAC structure, a new high-fidelity event is generated. 

### Observable RBAC Events
You can filter the audit trail for the following event types to isolate permission changes:

* `user.invited`: When a new user is invited to the organization.
* `user.role_changed`: When a user is promoted (e.g. from `Viewer` to `Editor`).
* `user.removed`: When an identity is revoked from the workspace.
* `group.created`: When a new RBAC permissions group is established.
* `group.policy_attached`: When specific read/write policies are bound to a group.

If an orchestrator suddenly loses access to a provider, searching these event types allows you to definitively and historically prove who changed the underlying permissions and exactly when.
