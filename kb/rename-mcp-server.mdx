# Renaming Your MCP Server

## Using HasMCP UI

![Server Edit Page](../images/kb/server-edit.png)

To rename a server directly in the browser:
1. From the Server Details page, click **Edit**.
2. Update the **Name** text field.
3. Click **Save** to confirm the new name.

## Using REST API

Yes, you can rename an MCP server at any time after it is created. Renaming a server does not break its underlying ID or token credentials.

### How to Rename a Server

To rename a server programmatically, you send a `PATCH` request to the specific server's endpoint:

`PATCH /servers/{id}`

In the JSON payload, simply provide the new `name` property within the `server` object. The HasMCP Manager will update the visual name of your server on the dashboard and in API listings, while keeping the internal configurations and bindings intact.

#### Example Payload

```json
{
 "server": {
 "name": "myNewDescriptiveAppName"
 }
}
```
