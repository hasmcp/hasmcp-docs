# Searching Providers by Name or URL

## Using HasMCP UI

![Providers List Page](../images/kb/providers-list.png)

You can easily search through your active API integrations by using the search bar located at the top of the **Providers** list page in the dashboard.

## Using REST API

Yes, when making a `GET` request to the `/providers` endpoint, HasMCP allows you to append query parameters to search for subsets of providers matching specific text strings. This is extremely helpful when managing a large catalog of APIs.

### Available Search Parameters

The `/providers` endpoint supports the following two query string parameters for text-based searches:

1. **`nameContains`** (string): Filters the returned array of providers to only those where the `name` field contains the specified substring (case-insensitive depending on database collation).
2. **`baseURLContains`** (string): Filters the returned array to only providers where the `baseURL` incorporates the specified substring.

### Example Queries

#### Searching by Name
To find all providers that have "Google" in their name:

```bash
curl -G -X GET https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/providers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  --data-urlencode "nameContains=Google"
```

#### Searching by Base URL
To locate any provider mapping to a subdomain of `internal.mycompany.com`:

```bash
curl -G -X GET https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/providers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  --data-urlencode "baseURLContains=internal.mycompany.com"
```
