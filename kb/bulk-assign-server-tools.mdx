# Bulk Assigning Server Tools

## Single Association Architecture

Currently, the HasMCP API philosophy revolves around discrete, explicit capability grants. The primary endpoint for authorizing a tool (`POST /servers/{serverId}/tools`) expects a solitary `ServerTool` mapping object per request. 

**There is no native single REST endpoint that accepts an array of tool parameters to instantiate a massive bulk mapping in one transaction.**

## Creating Bulk Workflows Programmatically

To achieve bulk assignment when migrating environments or initializing complex composite AI models, administrators can easily script the iteration. 

Because the endpoint is lightweight, you can iterate over arrays of target `toolID` variables within standard automation scripts (Bash, Python, Go) executing rapid sequential `POST` calls.

### Example Automation Pattern (Bash)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Target Infrastructure
SERVER_ID="sE8vKd2qLp9"
PROVIDER_ID="kSuB9Gf6aD4"

# Array of Tools to Link
declare -a TARGET_TOOLS=(
 "tH4mZw9xV2n" 
 "aB8cV5nXm0q"
 "zP3lKj7yR1w"
)

# Loop and Post
for tool in "${TARGET_TOOLS[@]}"
do
 # Executing the individual POST request
 curl -X POST "https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers/${SERVER_ID}/tools" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d "{
 \"tool\": {
 \"serverID\": \"${SERVER_ID}\",
 \"providerID\": \"${PROVIDER_ID}\",
 \"toolID\": \"${tool}\"
 }
 }"
done
```

> **Performance Note:** The HasMCP orchestration engine handles synchronous capability additions rapidly. All tools bound sequentially via iteration will immediately index and reflect simultaneously on the next `tools/list` LLM request.
