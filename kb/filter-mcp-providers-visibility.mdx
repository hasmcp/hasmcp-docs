# Filtering Providers by Visibility

Yes, HasMCP provides a native query parameter that allows you to cleanly filter the list of returned API providers based on their configured `visibilityType`. 

## Using HasMCP UI

While the dashboard search bar is primarily used for finding providers by name, API consumers dynamically loading integrations can easily segment the data by visibility.

## Using REST API

To retrieve a subset of providers filtered down to a specific visibility classification (`INTERNAL` or `PUBLIC`), you pass the `visibility` query string parameter to the list endpoint.

### The Request

Make a `GET` request to the `/providers` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/providers?visibility=INTERNAL' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Purpose of Visibility Filtering

This filtering capability is especially useful when:
1. You want to retrieve only `PUBLIC` APIs that third-party agent systems are permitted to access safely.
2. You want to audit all your `INTERNAL` specific data-source integrations securely isolated from general access.
