# The Server Resource Association Endpoint

To grant an MCP Server read-access to a newly minted Provider Resource (such as an internal documentation wiki or a system log), use the nested POST endpoint targeting the specific server identifier.

## The API Endpoint

**`POST /servers/{serverId}/resources`** 

By posting to this specific 11-character `{serverId}`, the HasMCP manager inherently knows which control-plane API to update.

### The JSON Dependency Payload

Your JSON payload must strictly conform to the `CreateServerResourceRequest` structure. It contains a `resource` object mapping exactly two constraints:

```json
{
 "resource": {
 "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
 "resourceID": "rA9BdO1kZ5T"
 }
}
```

- **`serverID`**: Must perfectly mirror the `{serverId}` deployed in your URL path.
- **`resourceID`**: The explicit 11-character hash pointing to the data mapping sitting inside the Provider. Note that the API relies on HasMCP's internal abstraction engine to automatically deduce the origin Provider from the `resourceID` globally.

A successful assignment triggers a `200 OK`. Downstream LLMs connected to this exact server can immediately retrieve this newly linked data blob.
