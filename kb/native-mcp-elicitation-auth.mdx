# Native MCP Elicitation Auth

When building powerful enterprise applications, certain downstream APIs (like Salesforce, Jira, or Google Drive) require explicit user-level authentication. 

You cannot use a single hardcoded API key for an entire company; each user accessing the AI Agent must verify their own identity securely.

### The Elicitation Pattern

**Elicitation** is a core capability of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that explicitly handles this requirement natively.

If an LLM attempts to execute a secure Provider Tool, but HasMCP detects that the user's specific OAuth token is missing or expired, the proxy executes an "Elicitation Flow":

1. HasMCP catches the execution pause.
2. It sends an `elicitation` command directly back up the SSE (MCP Streamable HTTP) stream to the user's Claude Desktop application.
3. Claude Desktop natively pops up an interactive modal on the user's screen.
4. The user inputs their specific credentials (or completes an OAuth login flow) directly inside the desktop client.
5. The credentials are passed back down smoothly. HasMCP dynamically resumes the paused execution request seamlessly and transparently.

Because this runs organically through the official MCP protocol, developers do not need to build complex custom React frontends to manage API login modals. HasMCP completely handles the logic state.
