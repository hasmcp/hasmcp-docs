# Listing Server Variables via API

Because Variables orchestrate data injection globally across all valid MCP Server contexts, polling the master `GET` endpoint securely reveals every explicit integration dependency logically mapped across your application boundaries.

## The API Request

To retrieve all global parameters available to configured generic extensions:

**`GET /variables`**

```bash
curl -X GET https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/variables \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Understanding the Response

The array returns JSON object nodes strictly defining variable IDs, names, and timestamp metrics. 

### Secrets Scrubbing

If an instantiated object historically possessed the type classification `SECRET` inside the HasMCP cluster, the output payload intentionally destroys the physical string format for safe terminal polling:

```json
{
 "variables": [
 {
 "id": "m9K2p7v4L1x",
 "createdAt": "2026-02-15T18:32:00Z",
 "updatedAt": "2026-02-15T18:32:00Z",
 "type": "SECRET",
 "name": "API_PINECONE_IO_DB_KEY",
 "value": "***"
 }
 ]
}
```

The `"***"` mask ensures that scripts logging HTTP responses do not inadvertently leak cryptography definitions structurally.
