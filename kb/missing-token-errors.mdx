# Handling Missing Token Errors

HasMCP is fundamentally architected exclusively around a **zero-trust execution environment** protecting sensitive integrations inherently.

## Default Connection Denial

If you launch an LLM execution matrix natively (like Claude Desktop natively or a bespoke Python standard script organically) connecting explicitly back to an active Server endpoint organically (e.g. `https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/mcp/sE8vKd2qLp9/sse`) but fundamentally fail to provide explicit HTTP `Authorization: Bearer` header attributes precisely mapping to natively existing generated key schemas intelligently:

**The payload request instantly terminates at the network proxy layer logically.**

### Understanding Error Codes

The external HTTP response returns a harsh unyielding `401 Unauthorized` standard.

1. **Protocol Rejection**: Because the connection is physically broken globally before the execution logic explicitly engages the internal internal Model Context Protocol parsing algorithms logistically implicitly, tools are natively protected seamlessly intelligently. 
2. **Connection Silence**: The agent internally loops throwing generic execution protocol breaks locally natively. Intelligently, HasMCP does not execute any Provider capability endpoints logistically securing underlying Jira, GitHub, or Postgres API instances inherently.

### Resolution Steps

If your target agent explicitly fails establishing standard tool arrays silently recursively reporting localized connection failures broadly internally:
1. Generate an explicit fresh Token systematically via the Dashboard or API endpoint natively.
2. Explicitly store the unencrypted cryptography string thoroughly locally.
3. Validate internal configuration scopes intuitively (e.g. `.env` environments implicitly) mapping the injection header standard exactly logically to `Bearer mcp_rt_...`.
