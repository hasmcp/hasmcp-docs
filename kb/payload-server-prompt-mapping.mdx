# Payload for Server Prompt Mapping

*Note: Visual UI management for Provider Prompts is currently under active development. Utilizing Prompts currently requires the HasMCP REST API.*

Unlike configuring explicit structural Tools—which enforces specifying the origin `providerID` inside the payload mapping to prevent transversal vulnerabilities—associating Prompts utilizes an abstracted, flattened architecture mapped natively by ID.

## Standard POST Instantiation

To bridge a programmatic template via the `POST /servers/{serverId}/prompts` endpoint, you must adhere strictly to the [`CreateServerPromptRequest`](/api-reference/servers/prompts/create-mcp-server-prompt-association) wrapper constraints.

### Implicit Relationships

Because HasMCP assigns a globally unique string hash across every platform entity dynamically, the routing layer automatically interpolates the `providerID` intuitively by analyzing the target `promptID`. Therefore, the creation payload only requires declaring two mapping strings:

- **`serverID`** *(string)*: Must rigorously match the `{serverId}` variable deployed in the HTTP action URI string. Dictates the destination orchestrator node.
- **`promptID`** *(string)*: The pre-calculated globally unique identifier of your overarching prompt target entity.

```json
{
 "prompt": {
 "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
 "promptID": "mX5vTr9pK2w"
 }
}
```

Posting this JSON structure natively bridges the orchestration pipeline safely, rejecting attempts immediately if the origin mapping hashes deviate from available contextual scopes or execution boundaries.
