# Creating a New MCP Server in HasMCP

## Using HasMCP UI

![New Server Creation Page](../images/kb/create-server.png)

To create a new MCP server through the dashboard:
1. Navigate to the **Servers** section from the sidebar.
2. Click the **Create Server** or **New Server** button.
3. Fill in the required fields such as the server's name and its behavioral instructions.
4. Save your configuration to instantly provision the server.

## Using REST API

To create a new MCP server programmatically, you need to make a `POST` request to the `/servers` endpoint with a JSON payload containing your server's configuration.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare Authentication**: Ensure you have your HasMCP Manager API token. You will need to pass this in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token (`Bearer ${HASMCP_ACCESS_TOKEN}`).
2. **Define Server Configuration**: Create a JSON payload that specifies the `name`, `instructions`, `version`, and any associated `providers`, `resources`, or `prompts`.
3. **Send the Request**: Make a `POST` request to `https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers` (or your specific HasMCP Manager base URL) with the compiled JSON body.

### Example cURL Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "server": {
      "name": "My Custom MCP Server",
      "instructions": "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
      "version": 1,
      "providers": []
    }
  }'
```

A successful request will return a `201 Created` status code along with the newly created server's details.
