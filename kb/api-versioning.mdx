# API Versioning

HasMCP enforces a global URL path structure to mandate strictly maintained version iterations gracefully:

`https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/`

- **`v1`**: All core resources, endpoints, and authentication capabilities organically reside under the `v1` path prefix. 

This explicit URL structure guarantees downstream MCP Agents and custom orchestration scripts never experience unexpected structural changes organically. If fundamental architectural shifts natively necessitate a new foundational data structure, a `v2` endpoint path will be deliberately exposed, cleanly maintaining execution continuity for all `v1` proxy agents natively seamlessly.
