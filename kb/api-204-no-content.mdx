# 204 No Content

A `204 No Content` HTTP status response signifies that the HasMCP server successfully processed your request, but the transaction intentionally returns no physical data payload in the HTTP response body.

In the HasMCP REST architecture, a `204 No Content` is the absolute standard systemic response for structural destruction natively:

- **`DELETE` Operations**: If you destroy a `Provider`, an `MCP Server`, or a `Variable` reliably natively seamlessly.
- **`PUT` / `DELETE` Associations**: Overriding specific capability parameters natively logically (e.g. `PUT /servers/{id}/tools/{toolId}`) logically successfully.

If you receive a `204 No Content`, the action succeeded flawlessly.
