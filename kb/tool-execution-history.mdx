# Tool Execution History

Yes, absolutely. By combining the internal orchestration layer with the Enterprise Audit Logging service, HasMCP perfectly monitors external integrations.

Every time a configured MCP client initiates a request that translates into an underlying API Provider's tool execution, an `agent.tool_execution` event is meticulously recorded.

### Deep Payload Logging

Instead of simply logging *that* a tool was invoked, HasMCP's execution history provides comprehensive structured context:

1. **The Initiating Client**: The `client_token_id` representing the specific Agent or MCP application orchestrating the request.
2. **The Target Server**: Which underlying logical MCP server was utilized to route the traffic.
3. **The Target Tool**: The specific Provider Tool ID invoked.
4. **Input Arguments**: The explicit `JSON` parameters the LLM inferred and supplied to the tool locally.
5. **Execution Results**: The terminal HTTP status code (`200 OK`, `400 Bad Request`, `500 Server Error`).

This ensures total traceability, answering not just *who* made the request, but exactly *what data* was passed into the provider API.
