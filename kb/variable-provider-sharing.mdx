title: Can a variable be shared among different providers?

# Sharing Variables Across Providers

**Yes.** By default, all HasMCP Variables operate as universally accessible global configurations dynamically mapped during runtime.

Because you create a Variable at the root infrastructure level (i.g. `POST /variables`), the literal parameter exists entirely independent of individual Servers or specific Providers. This decoupled architecture is intentional.

## How Sharing Works

If you establish an explicit global Secret named `GITHUB_PRIVATE_TOKEN`, the orchestration logic treats that string as a universal key.

1. **Provider 1 (Github Pull Requests)**: You deploy a Provider focused on managing PR logic mapped to Server A. The Provider configures its internal tool execution loop to query the `GITHUB_PRIVATE_TOKEN` mapping. HasMCP securely injects the value downstream at runtime.
2. **Provider 2 (Github Issue Sync)**: You deploy a secondary Provider focused entirely on syncing internal Jira tickets to Github issues on Server B. This tool also explicitly queries `GITHUB_PRIVATE_TOKEN`. HasMCP effortlessly pipelines the identical Secret into this distinct proxy loop simultaneously.

By adopting a universal `Variable` repository design, you guarantee single-source-of-truth configuration management natively. If a core API key inherently rotates externally, you only update the single HasMCP Variable—and every downstream Provider demanding that key receives the updated payload automatically upon the next execution request.
