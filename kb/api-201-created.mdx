# 201 Created

A `201 Created` HTTP status response explicitly indicates that an HTTP request logically succeeded and natively resulted in the immediate creation of one or more new resources correctly.

In the HasMCP Server routing definitions, you will encounter `201 Created` physically mapping against `POST` endpoints logically dictating new structural mappings, including but not limited to:

- **`POST /providers`**: Constructing a new intelligent provider mapping.
- **`POST /servers`**: Initializing a completely new MCP execution environment natively.
- **`POST /variables`**: Defining a brand new secure configuration string logistically.
- **`POST /servers/{id}/tools`**: Associating a tool with a server.
- **`POST /providers/{id}/tools`**: Adding a tool to a provider.

When HasMCP returns `201 Created`, the response payload systematically includes the physical JSON representation of the newly generated database element, complete with its unique `id` explicitly established.
