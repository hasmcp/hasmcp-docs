# The Server Variable Creation Endpoint

To programmatically seed your ecosystem with API Keys, configuration parameters , securely leverage the primary proxy interface.

## The Global API Endpoint

**`POST /variables`**

By targeting this root definition.

### The JSON Dependency Payload

Your JSON payload must format conforming to the `CreateVariableRequest` organically. 

It explicitly expects a cleanly nested `variable` dictionary defining precisely three key constraints :

```json
{
 "variable": {
 "name": "MYDB_SQL_CONNECTION_URI",
 "value": "postgres://user:pass@mydb:5432/main",
 "type": "SECRET"
 }
}
```

- **`name`** *(string)*: The explicit literal character string the downstream Model Context Protocol container natively demands.
- **`value`** *(string)*: The unformatted text value inherently mapped.
- **`type`** *(string)*: Define either `ENV` `SECRET`.

A technically perfect transaction results returning `201 Created` housing the new `Variable` object.
