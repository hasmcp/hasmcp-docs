# Disassociating a Resource from an MCP Server

## Using HasMCP UI

If a specific set of data is no longer pertinent to a server's underlying function (or represents a security leak for that specific agent prompt), remove it utilizing the dashboard interface:

1. Click into the deployed server via the **MCP Servers** layout.
2. Select the **Resources** tab to view your active bindings.
3. Locate the row mapping the resource you want to deny.
4. Click the associated **Remove** (or Delete) icon.
5. Accept the destructive confirmation module to definitively unbind the association.

## Using REST API

For pipeline automations enforcing dynamic access permissions depending on the time of day or trigger type, you can revoke access surgically utilizing the `DELETE` verb.

### The API Endpoint

**`DELETE /servers/{serverId}/resources/{resourceId}`**

You must pinpoint the exact `serverId` housing the agent connection, specifically targeting the explicit 11-character hash dictating the `resourceId` you wish to sever.

### Example Rejection Request

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers/sE8vKd2qLp9/resources/rA9BdO1kZ5T \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

The HasMCP routing engine processes this instruction instantly, replying with an empty `204 No Content` response block. Any persistent LLM connections previously caching this resource will error out natively if they blindly request its URI path moving forward.
