# Connecting to Corporate VPNs

Because HasMCP operates via a distributed proxy architecture, you can execute tool interactions explicitly against infrastructure locked deep inside a private corporate Intranet.

### Desktop Execution

If a developer is physically sitting on the corporate VPN and running Claude Desktop locally:

1. They construct their HasMCP API configuration natively.
2. The LLM agent receives the generic instruction: "Check internal HR database".
3. The LLM executes the command through the local MCP protocol.
4. If the downstream Provider API target resolved by HasMCP points to `http://internal-hr-db.corp.local`, the developer's machine executes the request *directly through the VPN tunnel*.

Because the physical execution originates from the developer's trusted laptop connection, it naturally resolves the internal corporate DNS safely.

### Dedicated Enterprise Tunnels

For automated agents executing in the cloud (not on a local developer machine), HasMCP Enterprise provides dedicated **Site-to-Site VPN** and **AWS PrivateLink** integration. Our cluster physical architecture is directly bridged to your VPC, ensuring isolated data flows never traverse the open internet.
