# Retrieving Details of a Specific Provider Prompt

If you need the exhaustive JSON schema mapping of an individual prompt programmatically, structure a `GET` request uniquely identifying its exact ID nested within its parent provider.

## Using REST API

### The API Endpoint

**`GET /providers/{providerId}/prompts/{id}`**

You must provide two specific hash identifiers to form the endpoint:
- `{providerId}`: The ID dictating the overarching API integration domain.
- `{id}`: The distinct 11-character hash linking directly to this individual Prompt.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/providers/kSuB9Gf6aD4/prompts/pT9XyM1qL2b \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

If successful, the API serves a [`GetProviderPromptResponse`](/api-reference/providers/prompts/get-provider-prompt) with a `200 OK` status. This payload yields the complete `prompt` dictionary mapping its parameterized `arguments` and the nested array structuring its formatted `messages`.
