title: Does deleting a server-tool association delete the tool itself?

# Scope of Association Deletions

## Short Answer

**No.** Deleting a server-tool association only breaks the routing link for that specific server. The underlying tool remains safely inside its Provider catalog.

## Architectural Separation

HasMCP enforces a strict [Data-Plane vs. Control-Plane] separation:
- **Providers (The Data Plane):** This is where tools, resources, and prompts physically exist. Providers are the ultimate source of truth for the capabilities.
- **Servers (The Control Plane):** This is where execution is orchestrated. Servers act as brokers, gathering up authorized capabilities from the Data Plane to present to LLMs.

### The Impact of Deleting an Association

When you execute an association deletion via the UI or the `DELETE /servers/{serverId}/tools/{toolId}` endpoint, the manager simply removes that `ServerTool` entry from the relational association database.

1. **The Server Impact:** The individual MCP Server immediately stops listing that tool when queried by AI agents. Any attempt to `tools/call` that specific tool via that server will fail.
2. **The Provider Impact:** The Tool remains entirely untouched within the Provider's configuration.
3. **Other Servers' Impact:** If `Server B` corresponds to the exact same tool, its integration remains flawlessly intact because it holds a discrete, independent relational mapping.

You can comfortably "grant" and "revoke" tool associations across dozens of MCP servers without ever risking the deletion or corruption of the underlying API tool implementations inside your providers.
