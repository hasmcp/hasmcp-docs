# Deleting a Provider Prompt

When a prompt template becomes fundamentally obsolete, or when you consolidate logic down into generic tooling abstractions, you should aggressively wipe out the old prompt mappings.

## Using REST API

### The API Endpoint

**`DELETE /providers/{providerId}/prompts/{id}`**

### Actioning the Deletion

Using the 11-character hash IDs delineating the explicit path down to the object, run the authenticated delete command.

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/providers/kSuB9Gf6aD4/prompts/pT9XyM1qL2b \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

The system will respond immediately with a `204 No Content` representing success.

> **Execution Impact:** Purging a root `ProviderPrompt` initiates a destructive, cascading ripple effect removing every `ServerPrompt` link mapped sequentially to it. Ensure no active AI agents implicitly rely on this specific prompt ID in their initialization routines before deletion.
