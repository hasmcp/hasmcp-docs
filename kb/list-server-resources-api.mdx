# Listing All Resources Attached to an MCP Server

## Using HasMCP UI

If you need a human-readable visual confirmation of precisely what data endpoints your LLM can read:
1. Navigate to your target Server inside the **MCP Servers** dashboard.
2. Select the **Resources** tab.
3. This dynamically queries the `listServerResources` request, rendering out all authorized data blob definitions (including their MIME types and human-readable names) alongside the provider configurations acting as their hosts.

## Using REST API

Automated orchestration frameworks or observability dashboards can fetch the live catalog of a server's data integrations actively using the `GET` resources array endpoint.

### The API Endpoint

**`GET /servers/{serverId}/resources`**

### Formatting the Request

```bash
curl -X GET https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers/sE8vKd2qLp9/resources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

A properly formed, authenticated request returns the `ListServerResourcesResponse` payload. Inside, a `resources` array lists out every individual association block, definitively outlining the `serverID` and `resourceID` mappings explicitly exposing data down to the end-user Model Context Protocol client.
