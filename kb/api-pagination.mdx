# API Pagination

When querying overarching HasMCP list databases directly via the external REST architectural layer (e.g. listing dozens of tools or servers), a standard cursor-based pagination model is systematically deployed.

HasMCP strictly enforces tokenized orchestration to ensure fast query responses and limit payload sizes.

## The Pagination Parameters

All `GET` endpoints that return a `List[Entity]Response` accept two core URL query strings:

- **`limit`**: An integer dictating the maximum explicit number of physical objects allowed to be returned. Example: `?limit=100`.
- **`token`**: The opaque cryptographic cursor identifying the specific database offset for the next page of results. 

## The Response Structure

A successfully processed array payload reliably returns the data alongside pagination metadata:

```json
{
 "matchCount": 850,
 "nextToken": "A1B2C3D4E5F6",
 "data": [
 // array payload objects 
 ]
}
```

- **`matchCount`**: The total count of items matching the query parameters across all pages.
- **`nextToken`**: The cursor mapping to the next page of items. If this physical string returns `null`, you have reached the absolute end of the list intelligently.

To pull the next batch, append the returned token to your next request: `?token=A1B2C3D4E5F6`.
