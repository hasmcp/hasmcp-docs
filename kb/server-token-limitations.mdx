# Server Token Limitations

## Architectural Context

No, there are **no hard operational limits** imposed on the explicit total number of authentication Tokens assigned iteratively to a single running HasMCP `Server` object matrix. 

### Why Generate Dozens of Tokens?

Because the HasMCP architecture essentially standardizes the `Server ID` as the primary operational environment for a designated Model Agent workflow securely unifying tools and static resource mappings intrinsically—it makes pragmatic operational sense to bind large numbers of discrete client machines independently back to that solitary orchestrator ring.

For example, your "Internal Company Triage QA System" (Server `sE8vKd2qLp9`) exposes Jira, Confluence, and GitHub tools perfectly formatted.

You have fifty quality assurance engineers on your staff globally. 

Instead of creating fifty identical orchestrator server topologies manually mapping all tool associations repetitively over API POST structures natively, you dynamically construct **fifty independent `ServerTokens`** mapping inherently back onto the master `Server ID`. 

You distribute these strings dynamically securely inside each QA Engineer's local `.env` deployment structures natively bridging back to the Model Context Protocol stdio client.

When Engineer #37 leaves the company logically, you simply identify and target their explicitly minted key via the `revoke token` procedure seamlessly without intrinsically threatening the global architecture supporting the other forty-nine developers connected stably on the matrix.
