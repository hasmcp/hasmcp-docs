# MCP Server Composition

Composition is the architectural ability to intelligently bundle multiple distinct Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into a single unified routing endpoint securely.

In a mature enterprise, a useful AI Agent often requires simultaneous access to multiple systems: Github, Jira, Postgres, and internal REST endpoints.

If you attempt this without HasMCP, you must transmit four distinct URLs and four completely different API authentication tokens to every single engineer on your team. Every time a connection string rotates, twenty developers have to manually update their `claude_desktop_config.json`.

**MCP Server Composition** explicitly solves this configuration bottleneck by generating a single unified Master Endpoint.

### How it Works

1. You securely connect your upstream databases and APIs entirely inside the HasMCP Dashboard.
2. You create an **Interface** called `Core_Engineering_Suite`.
3. You drag-and-drop the specific Provider Tools you want into that Interface.
4. HasMCP outputs a single, immutable streaming URL.

Your engineers plug exactly **one** endpoint into their IDEs. The HasMCP proxy receives their prompts and efficiently distributes the underlying tool calls out to the proper databases in parallel.
