# Binding Multiple Resources to a Server

**Yes**. A single MCP Server instance is explicitly designed to act as a unified proxy to a diverse constellation of static and dynamic data Resources.

## Architecting Aggregation

When you assign multiple Resources to an individual Server (for example: linking `app_error_logs`, `database_schema`, and `company_wiki_index` simultaneously), the HasMCP server controller aggregates their standardized mappings. 

When your LLM queries `resources/list` over the unified Server connection, it consumes all three disparate data feeds in a single comprehensive dictionary response.

### Adding Them Rapidly via API

Because there isn't a native array-based bulk-post REST endpoint currently open for resources, you orchestrate this by stacking individual assignment declarations securely:

```json
// Example: Attaching Resource 1
{
  "resource": {
    "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
    "resourceID": "appErrorLogs_ID"
  }
}
```

```json
// Example: Attaching Resource 2 immediately following
{
  "resource": {
    "serverID": "sE8vKd2qLp9",
    "resourceID": "dbSchemaDocs_ID"
  }
}
```

### Contextual Enrichment
By aggregating multiple disparate resources into a highly constrained Server agent, you effectively "train" the running LLM memory buffer locally without resorting to high-latency RAG vector database queries, making contextual lookup radically faster and strictly permissioned.
