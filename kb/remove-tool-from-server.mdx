# Removing a Tool Association from an MCP Server

## Using HasMCP UI

![Remove Server Tool Confirmation](../images/kb/remove-server-tool.png)

When an AI agent no longer needs an execution capability, it's best practice to explicitly sever the integration for security reasons.

1. Locate the specific MCP server on the dashboard.
2. Open its **Tools** tab.
3. Find the tool you wish to revoke in the active list.
4. Click its **Remove Tool** (Delete) action. 
5. Confirm the action in the validation modal.

> **Crucial Detail:** Clicking "Remove Tool" within a server's dashboard *only severs the association link* between the server and the tool. It **does not** delete the underlying tool definition from the parent Provider catalog.

## Using REST API

To procedurally enforce least-privilege principles by revoking a tool programmatically, you command the manager to destroy the mapping linkage.

### The API Endpoint

**`DELETE /servers/{serverId}/tools/{toolId}`**

You must map both the 11-character `{serverId}` housing the capability and the exact `{toolId}` to be expunged.

### Actioning the Deletion

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.hasmcp.com/api/v1/servers/sE8vKd2qLp9/tools/tH4mZw9xV2n \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Because deletion implies state modification without data return, the system triggers a `204 No Content` code. The server's MCP clients will immediately cease returning the tool in standardized `tools/list` interactions.
