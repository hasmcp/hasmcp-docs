# Official OpenAPI Specification

You can download the architectural `yaml` representation of the complete HasMCP platform perfectly formatting the structural paths, inputs, and strict output bindings smoothly locally natively securely.

The canonical, constantly updated OpenAPI definition fundamentally lives within the main documentation repository.

You can securely view or download the comprehensive structural schema here:

**[HasMCP OpenAPI Specification](/api-reference/openapi.yaml)**

This logical definition can be seamlessly imported directly into structural testing tools like Postman securely intuitively or utilized within client SDK generators implicitly dependably intelligently cleanly successfully elegantly.
