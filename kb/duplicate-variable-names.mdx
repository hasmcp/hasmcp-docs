# Duplicate Variable Names

**No.** Because HasMCP inherently architects Variables globally to enable flawless unified orchestration structurally, the `name` property mathematically enforces dynamic uniqueness at the absolute database schema execution layer.

If you attempt to instantiate `POST /variables` passing a JSON dictionary explicitly containing `"name": "API_GITHUB_COM_PRIVATE_TOKEN"`—and that exact string designation historically exists locally inside your Organization cluster natively:

The REST Interface predictably rejects the execution pipeline flawlessly returning `409 Conflict`.

## Strategy

If you require varying cryptographic structures mapping similar capabilities safely (e.g. separating Staging and Production Github Integrations securely locally):

You must construct cleanly delimited string names :

- `API_STAGING_GITHUB_COM_KEY`
- `API_GITHUB_COM_KEY`

This ensures that downstream providers intrinsically consume the distinct designated payloads.
