## Managing API Providers

In HasMCP, a **Provider** is the blueprint for an external service. It defines _where_ the API lives (Base URL), _how_ to authenticate with it (Headers or OAuth), and _what_ capabilities (Endpoints) are available.

Think of a Provider as a library of potential tools. You might define 50 endpoints for the "GitHub API" provider, but later create a specific MCP Server that only exposes 3 of them (e.g., "Read Issues") to the LLM.

## Creating a Provider

1. Navigate to the **Providers** tab.
2. Click the **\+ (Plus)** button to open the creation form.
3. **Basic Configuration**:
   - **Name**: A friendly name (e.g., `StripeApi`).
   - **Base URL**: The root address for all requests (e.g., `https://api.stripe.com/v1`).
   - **Description**: Context for the LLM to understand what this service does.
   - **Visibility**:
     - `INTERNAL`: Only visible to you.
     - `PUBLIC`: (Future feature) Intended for sharing within an organization.
4. **Provider Type**: Currently, only `REST` is supported.

> **⚠️ Immutable Fields**: The **Base URL** and the auto-generated **Secret Prefix** cannot be changed once the provider is created. If you make a mistake here, you will need to delete and recreate the provider.

## Authentication Configuration

HasMCP supports two primary methods for authenticating with external APIs.

### 1. Header-Based Authentication (API Keys)

This is the most common method. You define authentication headers at the **Endpoint level**, injecting secrets from your [Environment Variables](essentials/variables).

- **Usage**: See the [Managing Endpoints](#managing-endpoints) section below.

### 2. OAuth2 Configuration

If the API requires an OAuth2 flow (like "Log in with Google"), you configure the client details at the Provider level.

- **Enable OAuth2 Configuration**: Toggle this switch during creation or editing.
- **Fields Required**:
  - **Client ID**: Your public application ID.
  - **Client Secret**: Your private application secret.
  - **Auth URL**: The page where the user logs in (e.g., `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`).
  - **Token URL**: The endpoint used to exchange code for token (e.g., `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`).

> **Note**: HasMCP handles the OAuth handshake (callback handling and token storage) automatically when you authorize an MCP Server later. You just need to provide the correct endpoints here.

## Managing Endpoints

Endpoints represent the specific actions (HTTP requests) that the LLM can perform. You can add them in two ways:

### Option A: Importing OpenAPI / Swagger (Recommended)

The fastest way to onboard an API is to import its specification.

1. Inside a Provider, click the **Import (Cloud Download)** icon.
2. Paste your **OpenAPI 3.x** or **Swagger 2.0** JSON/YAML spec.
3. Click **Start Import**.

**Import Behavior:**

- **Matching**: HasMCP matches endpoints based on `METHOD + PATH` (e.g., `GET /users`).
- **Updates**: If an endpoint already exists, it will be updated with the new spec details.
- **New**: If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
- **Variables**: HasMCP automatically detects security schemes in the spec and creates placeholders for headers (e.g., `${API_STRIPE_COM_KEY}`).

### Option B: Manual Creation

For internal tools or simple APIs, you can use the visual builder.

1. Click the **\+ (Plus)** button next to "Provider Endpoints".
2. **Method & Path**: Select the verb (GET, POST, etc.) and the path (must start with `/`).
   - _Path Parameters_: Use curly braces for dynamic values, e.g., `/users/{id}`. HasMCP automatically generates the schema for these.
3. **Description**: Crucial for the LLM. Describe _what_ this tool does and _when_ to use it.
4. **Headers**: Add any static headers or dynamic variables required for this specific endpoint.
   - _Validation_: You can only reference variables that start with this provider's **Secret Prefix**.

## Defining Schemas

For an LLM to successfully call an API, it needs to know strictly what data to send. HasMCP allows you to define JSON Schemas for both inputs and outputs.

### Query Arguments

Define parameters appended to the URL (e.g., `?limit=10&status=active`).

- **Type**: String, Number, Boolean, or Arrays.
- **Required**: Mark fields that are mandatory.
- **Description**: Explain what the parameter controls (e.g., "Number of items to return, max 100").

### Request Body (JSON)

For `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests, you must define the payload structure.

**The "Smart Inference" Feature**: You don't need to write complex JSON Schema manually.

1. Paste a **sample JSON payload** into the "Sample Body or Schema" text area.

   ```
   {
     "name": "New Project",
     "private": true
   }
   
   ```
2. HasMCP will automatically convert this into a valid JSON Schema when you save, adding types and structure definitions for the LLM.

### OAuth2 Scopes

If you enabled OAuth2 for the provider, you can define specific **Scopes** required for each endpoint (e.g., `read:user`, `repo:status`). These are cumulative; when a user authorizes an MCP Server, HasMCP requests the union of all scopes for the enabled endpoints.
